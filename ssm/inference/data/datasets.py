  The observations are produced every steps_per_observation timesteps as a
  function of the latent zs. For example if steps_per_observation is 3 then the
  first observation will be produced as a function of z3:

  x1 ~ N(observation_fn(z3), observation_variance)

  where observation_fn could square z3, take the absolute value, or pass

      "standard" centers the transition density at the previous latent state,

    observation_type: Must be one of "squared", "abs" or "standard". "squared"
      centers the observation density at the squared latent state. "abs"
      centers the observaiton density at the absolute value of the current
